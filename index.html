				<strong>Insights about the data/visualization:</strong>
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>There were no COVID cases until the end of March</li>
				<li>COVID cases peaked in January 2022</li>
				<li>COVID cases increased steadily from March 2020 to January 2021 before declining and then increased again from June 2021 to September 2021</li>
				<li>COVID cases was lowest in this range during June 2021</li>

			</ul>

				<strong>Design Critique:</strong>
			</p>

			<p>
				At a first glance, I think that it is relatively clear where to start looking due to the year labels. I appreciated the use of a key/scale to correlate the size to an actual number of COVID cases, but I do think that it is generally hard to quickly estimate sizes without using your fingers or a ruler, so I found myself focusing on general trends rather than specific data points. In other words, the quantities were basically hidden from the readers. I really liked the choice to use continuous spiral that changed in size because it was very easy to see how the number of COVID cases was changing over time and the spiral creates a sense of “infiniteness”, suggesting that COVID is not going away any time soon and is a virus we will continue to encounter in the future. On the other hand, the radial/spiral shape made it harder for me to compare the number of COVID cases for months that aren’t next to each other. For me, the radial design is harder to read and interpret than a typical bar or line graph, and it does not match the intuitive and standardized representation of time which is often depicted as a timeline or as a calendar. While I appreciated having a few month labels at each quarter, I initially didn’t realize that each year spanned all 360 degrees of the spiral, so I spent some time counting to determine which month I was in. I think that this is another drawback of the spiral shape, because each year ends up having a different size because 2021 is further from the center, so the circumference is a lot larger. This creates a distracting distortion of year length. I think that it could also help to label all the months to minimize work done by the reader. Lastly, I was confused by what the 7-day average was referring to and think that this could have used some more clarification. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Whether or not this is a good design is so dependent on the goal of the visualization. If the author was aiming to illustrate overall trends and depict COVID as a never ending cycle, this graph does a relatively good job at that. If the goal is to offer detailed insights into the number of cases in each month of the COVID outbreak, this does not accomplish that very well. Reading the article, it seems that the author was aiming to show that January 2022 will see a big surge in cases, and have a record-high number of new cases. I do think that this observation is highlighted clearly in the visualization.

				<strong>Design Rationale for Sketch 1:</strong>
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>For this sketch, I didn’t want to change too much from the original. I addressed some readability issues by labelling each section with the month and using a bold red line to indicate the start of each year
				</li>
				<li>Because it is hard to determine quantity from size, I decided to remove the key entirely so the focus is on the trends over time rather than specific data points
				</li>
				<li>I wanted to communicate the big surge of cases in January 2022 and the uncertainty of the future, so I decided to make data from 2020 and 2021 grey and use red only for the current year (at the time the article was released)
				</li>
				<li>I think that the spiral shape still doesn’t work too well and is generally hard to read and understand
				</li>
				<li>By not having any reference for the number of cases, there is no way to extrapolate actual data points
				</li>
				<li>I used a light red for the month labels and lines instead, but I think this made the graph seem a little messy
				</li>
				<li>I also used a brighter red than the one in the original graph to further emphasize January 2022, but I'm not sure if this made a big difference since any red is already a stark contrast from the grey.
				</li>
				<li>The title emphasizes two groups of comparison: 2020 and 2021 vs January 2022. This further refines the focus of the visualization on the surge of cases in January 2022</li>
				<li>In the next sketch, I want to try using a more conventional representation of time by using a linear structure rather than a spiral 
				</li>
				
			</ul>

			<p>
				<strong>Design Rationale for Sketch 2:</strong>
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>For this sketch, I wanted to use a linear structure to allow for easier side-to-side comparison of the quantity of COVID cases
				</li>
				<li>I think that it is easier to see that January has the highest number of new COVID cases since the beginning of the outbreak
				</li>
				<li>I chose to experiment with a different color, but I think that the color green lacks the intrinsic association with COVID
				</li>
				<li>Rather than using an axis, I just added 3 labels for various “peaks” in the data for reference. I don’t think this was very effective and think an axis or more standardized reference for quantity is needed to ensure no data is “hidden”
				</li>
				<li>I used tick marks to indicate the months and added labels for each quarter, but I think that these labels look rather messy and are not the easiest to see. They seem more like annotations of the data rather than labels
				</li>
				<li>Having the 2D area to represent the amount of COVID cases was not my favorite and I think it looks a bit messy in comparison to a standard line or area graph. This “2D” style also makes it harder to include an axis because the area is growing in both dimensions
				</li>
				<li>The title focuses more on the overall trends across 2020-2022 rather than just focusing on January 2022’s surge. 
				</li>
				<li>For the next sketch, I want to try a more conventional graph such as a line graph to include an axis to include more transparency on data points
				</li>
			</ul>

				<strong>Design Rationale for Sketch 3:</strong>
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>For this final sketch, I wanted to provide more clarity into actual granular data points rather than only showing the 7-day averages
				</li>
				<li>I used a classic line graph with axes for time and quantity reference
				</li>
				<li>I used two different colors for the average and the daily count, but I think that it would be more effective to use the same color palette because this would create an association between the two measures, since both measures are related to new confirmed cases.
				</li>
				<li>I didn’t include labels for each month within the year, but I don’t think this worked because it made it hard to compare each month
				</li>
				<li>I paired the 7-day average line with a bar for the actual daily count to provide more transparency into the calculation that was done, which could be important to people who need more specific data to trust a visualization 
				</li>
				<li>I included arrows on both axes to add a sense of “never ending-ness” to suggest that COVID is an issue that will continue – I’m not sure if this is really effective or needed
				</li>
				<li>I think that having the axis was helpful, but it would be even more helpful to annotate a few points for easier reference without having the draw a mental line from a point to the y-axis
				</li>
				<li>I added a label to indicate the day the article was released to show that the visualization is only using existing data and is not including any projections/predictions for the future 
				</li>
				<li>I also added a line connecting the actual data point to the axis to make it easier to see which data point was from “Today”.</li>

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

			<p>
        For the visualization, I wanted to focus more on the growth/increase in COVID cases rather than the cumulative 
		growth of COVID throughout the entire pandemic. I chose to focus on new cases, just like the original visualization, 
		because this is the information relevant to the contagiousness of COVID, whereas plotting deaths focuses more on 
		the mortality rate. Overall, I want to communicate that even though COVID started 2 years ago, it is still a 
		prevalent problem and without proper concern and consideration, it will continue to spread. From my sketches, I 
		liked my final iteration the most because I think it was able to juxtapose the 7-day averages with daily count data. 
		The daily count data provides transparency, as readers who are interested in granular data points have access to 
		those numbers. However, this data could be overwhelming to people who are less receptive to data, so the 7-day 
		average measure focuses more on the general trends in new COVID cases, leading to a smoother curve than the one 
		that would arise from using the daily count. In order to easily see both measures at once, I made the smoother 
		7-day average a line graph, and made the daily count a bar graph, but due to the dense nature of the daily data, 
		it almost leads to an overall area graph effect. I also chose to use a standard graph with two linear axes for 
		easier comparison of the number of new cases between month, even if they are not side-by-side.
		In terms of color, I chose to make the 7-day average line and the daily count 
		bars shades of red rather than two different colors to illustrate that both measures are using the same data 
		(New Confirmed Cases). Rather than labeling directly on the graph, I included a legend to show which marks are 
		associated to what measure, for clarity. In terms of axes, I chose not to scale the y-axis by thousands because 
		I think that this gets confusing when the value exceeds 1 million, as it shows as 1000K. Thus, I think that listing 
		the number in standard format is easier to read. I also did not scale down the y-axis’s range to under 1 million 
		because I wanted to suggest that, in a way, there is still room for the number of cases to “grow”, creating a 
		sense of “never ending-ness”. For the x-axis, I chose to display the month and year rather than the dates, as 
		this would make the axis very messy to read. I chose to include every other month rather than every quarter, 
		like the original, because this requires less counting from the reader. I showed tick marks for every month so 
		it was easy to correlate the month with the data. Lastly, I added two annotations to the graph. In order to 
		communicate how much the number of COVID cases has surged in the current month (January 2022), I highlighted 
		the actual number of cases from January 2021, and the actual number from January 2022. For January 2022, I made 
		the text and border red to emphasize this annotation. I think that my visualization might over-emphasize the 
		surge in January 2022 because it uses the red box with text to explicitly call out this data point. This 
		visualization also does not say anything about the number of recovered cases or deaths, so this could cause 
		a reader to falsely exaggerate the mortality rate of COVID.

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        I think that my design addresses many of the critiques I highlighted in Step 2. My main concern with the original 
		graph is that it was not very easy to compare the number of new cases with months that are not side-by-side. 
		By using linear axes, I think I addressed this concern. I also felt that there was not much transparency in the 
		data because it only showed the 7-day average, but my visualization shows the transformed (averaged) and untransformed 
		values, increasing transparency. I was surprised by the influence of color and how muhc a difference this made. For me,
		I learned I really associate COVID with red, and any other color didn't seem as fitting. 
		I think that this “critique by redesign” process really showed me how difficult it is 
		to show all the data we are given. While I aimed to prioritize transparency, it was rather difficult to keep my mind 
		open to all possible trends in the data because I went in with an intended hypothesis. This hypothesis almost limited 
		me to only look at the data in a “two-dimensional way”. In other words, I am only looking at the data to see whether 
		or not my hypothesis is true, but I am closing myself off to any other trends that might be in the data. While I wanted 
		to show deaths as well, for COVID specifically, I think it's hard to show death rates and growth rates on the same chart, 
		because the number of deaths is so much lower than the total number of new cases. However, using two different scales 
		for deaths and new cases could scare the general public because it would make the deaths seem a lot higher than they are. 
		On the other hand, by not scaling the deaths, it could underplay the change in deaths. It is a fact that COVID has led to 
		many lost lives, but how can we communicate that COVID is not just your regular flu/cold without scaring the public or 
		falsely portraying data? This might be too much responsibility for a singular visualization. I ultimately chose to focus 
		on the spread of COVID over time by only displaying data on new cases, but I admit that this is hiding information on the 
		mortality rate and “danger” of the virus.
